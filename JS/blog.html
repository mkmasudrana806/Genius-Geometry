            <h3>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
            <p>
              The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
              documents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents that allows
              programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content,
              structure, and style of a document."

              How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
            </h3>
            <p>The DOM provides several methods for selecting HTML elements.</p>
            <p>Here are Five DOM selectors</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>getElementById():</strong> it Returns the element with
                the specified ID.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>getElementsByClassName():</strong>it Returns
                HTMLCollection. we access by the specified class name.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> getElementsByTagName():</strong>it Returns
                HTMLCollection and we access elements with the specified tag
                name.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>querySelector():</strong> Returns the first element that
                matches a specified CSS selector. if we want to select an
                element which involved with id. then we need to use '#' before
                id name. it reuturn single element
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>querySelectorAll():</strong> it Returns NodeList that
                matches a specified CSS selector.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is event bubble?</h3>
            <p>
              Event bubbling is a type of DOM event propagation where the event
              first triggers on the innermost target element, and then
              successively triggers on the ancestors of the target element in
              the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM
              element

            <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
            <p>
              A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to
              another function. The callback function is then called by the
              outer function when the outer function is finished executing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Callback functions are often used in asynchronous programming,
              where the outer function may take some time to execute. By passing
              a callback function to the outer function, the programmer can
              specify what should happen when the outer function is finished
              executing.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, the following code shows how to use a callback
              function to print the results of a calculation:
            </p>
            <pre>
              function calculate(x, y, callback) { 
                var result = x + y;
              callback(result); 
            } 
              calculate(1, 2, function(result) {
              console.log(result); // Prints 3 });
            </pre>
            <p>
              In this example, the calculate() function takes three arguments:
              the two numbers to be added, and a callback function. The
              calculate() function then adds the two numbers and calls the
              callback function with the result. The callback function is called
              with the result of the calculation as its argument. In this
              example, the callback function simply prints the result to the
              console.
